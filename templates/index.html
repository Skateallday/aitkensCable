  <h1>Welcome to Aitkens</h1>
    <p>Aitkens… are an independent company, family owned and run. We are a major importer and cable management manufacturer based in Glasgow, Scotland. Our head office is located in Rutherglen with a 65,000 sq ft factory incorporating a trade counter, distribution and manufacturing plant. The company was established in 1977 and has built up an enviable reputation supplying the ‘first-fix’ market throughout the UK through our wholesaler / distribution partners & stockists, backed up with our growing branch network of distribution hubs currently in Leeds & Manchester and our experienced, flexible sales force we have never been better placed to service the industry.</p>
    <p>2017 will be our 40th year in business, something we are very proud off and a testament to our loyal staff members, suppliers and of course our customers, without them all our business today wouldn’t be valid.</p>
    <p>Aitkens have a policy of continual re-investment both in up to date machinery in our manufacturing and service sectors. This ensures that we keep our manufacturing costs as low as possible allowing us to be highly competitive in a demanding marketplace. Further investment in vehicles, staff, stock and IT help us to maintain our growing business and meet our future aspirations. Strong relationships with our suppliers and customers allow us to move with the times and mould our stock profile to the ever changing needs of the industry.</p>
